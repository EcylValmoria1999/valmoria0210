                <li>ICT- Information Communication technology is defined as a diverse set of technological tools and resources used to transmit, store, create, share or exchange information. It is one of the most usable technology in the world as we embrace more in the modernized and digitalized environment. Especially in communication, researches, entertainment, advanced transportation, digitalized things, computers and the likes. It helps people to innovate things and enhance our way of livings. Specially in the world of teaching itâ€™s very pivotal to effectuate standardized education through technologies to meet the interest of the modern learners.  
                    Through my traineeship journey, I widen my knowledge about technology it made me learned and unlearned those things to create new horizons. I am grateful enough that Alternative Learning System are collaborating with Northern Bukidnon State College for the Empowering Community ALS Implementers Through Digital Citizenship. With this I gained more ideas on how to manipulate computers, address computer problem or basic troubleshooting, Understanding Standard Error, making Power Point Presentation, Spreadsheets, and specially creating Web page. All throughout, we somehow find it more challenging because of some technical issues, miss communication, and out of time. But our facilitators were very attentive so it ends very smoothly. 
                    This training was beneficial for me as a 21st century teacher it helps me to make my teaching strategies more effective, engaging and create modernized learning environment.  In addition, sharing my knowledge about this Digital Citizenship to my diverse learners will help them embrace more on technology and comprehensively understand the digital world that leads them to become globally competitive individuals.
